Design-based education offers a learning-by-making approach to students’ learning and deepening of CS concepts through making realistic digital artifacts.
However, in many design projects, the link between the learning of concepts and designing is not clear.

This workshop aims at introducing and practicing an instructional model where both aspects of designing and learning are explicitly addressed.
To this end, first, we (Ebrahim Rahimi and Frans Peeters) will share our experience captured from two design projects based on this instructional model conducted in five secondary schools in the Netherlands.
Next, we together with the workshop participants will be working on hands-on activities aiming at generating and implementing algorithms required for developing an image-processing tool.
